## Learning Objectives

* Docker Compose orchestrates multiple containers as a single project
* Separation of concerns - don't package lots of software into a single container
* Build container images on-the-fly or deploy pre-built images
* Based on YAML configuration file
* Docker Compose is [open source](https://github.com/docker/compose), built using Python
* Common use cases:
  * Deploy a reverse proxy container alongside a web application
  * Deploy a database or in-memory cache alongside an application
  * Developers need to easily replicate a tech stack for development or debugging
  * Examples of [Docker Compose applications](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose)
